# Hasanah Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 17, 2026

Hasanah ("we", "our", or "us") is an offline-first Quran reading app.
This Privacy Policy explains what data the app uses, how it is used, and your choices.

## 1. Data We Use

### a) Location (optional, foreground only)
- **What:** Precise location (latitude/longitude) when you allow location permission.
- **Why:** To calculate accurate prayer times.
- **When:** Only when permission is granted and location is requested in the app.
- **Storage:** Saved locally on your device as part of prayer settings.

Hasanah does **not** use background location.

### b) App content and settings stored locally
- Reading preferences (theme, language, font/reading options)
- Prayer calculation settings
- Last read positions
- Study bookmarks, notes, tags, review status
- Selected reciter and download state

This data is stored locally on your device (AsyncStorage/SQLite/files).

### c) Recitation downloads (optional)
- If you choose to download recitation audio, the app fetches files from Quranic resource hosts (QUL/Tarteel sources) and stores them on your device for offline playback.
- We do not require account creation for downloads.

### d) External links you open
- If you tap links (for example review/share/source links), those open through your browser or store app and are subject to those services' own privacy policies.

## 2. Data We Do Not Collect

Hasanah does **not** include:
- User accounts or sign-in
- Advertising SDKs
- Analytics/tracking SDKs
- Sale of personal data
- Collection of contacts, photos, microphone recordings, or background location

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data.

Limited data may be processed by third parties only as needed to provide app functionality you request, such as:
- App distribution platforms (Google Play / Apple App Store)
- Recitation file hosts when downloading audio
- Browser/store apps when you open external links

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

Because data is stored on-device, it remains until you:
- delete it in-app (where supported),
- clear app data, or
- uninstall the app.

Examples:
- Study items can be deleted in the Study section.
- Recitation downloads can be removed in Recitation settings.

## 5. Security

We use reasonable measures to protect local app data. No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Hasanah is a general-audience Quran app and does not knowingly collect personal data from children through account systems.

## 7. International Use

If you download recitation files, network requests may be handled by providers in different regions.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted at the same policy URL with a revised effective date.
